== Installation ==

= The Good Way =

1. In your WordPress Admin, go to the Add New Plugins page
1. Search for: Show Current Template

= The Old Way =

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Does this plugin work with block themes? =
No. This plugin is useless when using block themes, and it shows a message that this plugin is useless when using block themes.

= I don't see the toolbar. =
Is the Toolbar (Show Toolbar when viewing site) option in your profile page is checked?
You can find your profile page is in your WordPress admin -> Users -> Profile.

= I don't see the current template file name in the toolbar. =
Do you logged in as "Administrator"? Other role users like "Editor" can't see the file name. If your WordPress is multisite, only super admin can see the file name.

= I'dont think this plugin is working properly.

Please try below:

* Activate one of the default themes.

Now the plugin work properly? Then it means there may be a compatibility issue between your theme and this plugin, so let me know your themeâ€™s name and where I can get it.

* Try to stop all plugins other than this plugin.
